# 2025 Display Next Hackfest

## About

The Display Next Hackfest is an event where talented developers will
gather to explore the latest technologies and trends in the Linux
Display Stack. It has an unconference format where participants propose
topics for presenting, roadmapping, discussing and examining together.
It aims to unblock bottlenecks, design solutions, raise pitfalls and
accommodate the needs of each layer of the display stack. Participants
should feel free to propose any topic which interests them. Some topics
from the previous edition include: HDR and color management, frame
timing and variable refresh rate (VRR), atomic flips, backlight control,
testing and CI, etc.

## Plans and Goals


1. **Keep moving!** Continue your work on upstream design, implementation and documentation until the hackfest.
1. **“Are you okay with that?”** Present the current status of your work, explain decisions, concerns and results. Let’s compromise.
1. **Share your pains.** What is well aligned with the generic approach? What is not (singularities) and how can we find room for it? Whatever your doubts, we resolve them together!
1. **“Something went wrong.”** Share failing tests or inconsistent results. Let’s take a look together and find how to overcome them!

The hackfest will last three days following an “Unconference” format. Check the event timetable and agenda below.

## Hotels

Both of these hotels are right next door to the AMD office:

- Courtyard by Marriott Toronto/Markham
- Residence Inn Toronto Markham

These are also within a short walk from the office:

- Hilton Garden Inn Toronto/Markham
- Holiday Inn Express & Suites Toronto-Markham

You should be able to ask for AMD corporate rates at these hotels. I'm
happy to send you the corporate rates if you need but don't want to
advertise them in public. If you have problems booking the hotel our
office admin can help with that with check-in/out dates, names, and
credit card info.
