# 2025 Display Next Hackfest

## About

The Display Next Hackfest is an event where talented developers will
gather to explore the latest technologies and trends in the Linux
Display Stack. It has an unconference format where participants propose
topics for presenting, roadmapping, discussing and examining together.
It aims to unblock bottlenecks, design solutions, raise pitfalls and
accommodate the needs of each layer of the display stack. Participants
should feel free to propose any topic which interests them. Some topics
from the previous edition include: HDR and color management, frame
timing and variable refresh rate (VRR), atomic flips, backlight control,
testing and CI, etc.

## Plans and Goals


1. **Keep moving!** Continue your work on upstream design, implementation and documentation until the hackfest.
1. **“Are you okay with that?”** Present the current status of your work, explain decisions, concerns and results. Let’s compromise.
1. **Share your pains.** What is well aligned with the generic approach? What is not (singularities) and how can we find room for it? Whatever your doubts, we resolve them together!
1. **“Something went wrong.”** Share failing tests or inconsistent results. Let’s take a look together and find how to overcome them!

The hackfest will last three days following an “Unconference” format. Check the event timetable and agenda below.
